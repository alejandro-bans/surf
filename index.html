	<h2>Aloha my friend ‚òÆÔ∏è</h2>
	<p>
		Before you apply to our school, it is important you know a little bit about what surf really is about.
		Surf is not just a sport. Surf is a commitment to yourself and the ocean. Surf is a spirituality, a way of living. Many surfers would even consider it their religion. Just like any religion, surfers believe in a power that is beyond them. Some will call it the power of nature, while some will say it‚Äôs the ocean, but they all worship this power in their heart. The excitement, the sheer adrenaline rush, and the pure blissful feeling of being one with nature and creating art are higher than just sports and recreation.
		If you are yet to experience true surfing, do not miss out the opportunity. Surfing can change your heart and soul. 
	</p>

	<h2>Are you ready? üåä</h2>
	<p>
		We can only teach you if you are ready to get out of your comfort zone, face your fears and push your limits... and hell is that tough when you are taking on the ocean!
		But just know... as long as you are smiling, you are doing it right.

	</p>
